Hello and welcome to my .Net assignment
Please pass in arguments with spaces as that is the only way it will work.
The only exception to this is when there is a X coefficient. e.g. 5X = 10, where 5 is the coefficient.
Also, please use capital 'X' as that is the identifier for the equation.
Thank you and kind regards,
